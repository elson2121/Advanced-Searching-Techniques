# Advanced-Searching-Techniques
This repository contains the implementation and analysis of three advanced searching algorithms:   - Exponential Search 🔍   - Jump Search 🚀   - Hashing-based Search 🔑    The project includes a theoretical explanation, complexity analysis, and a C++ implementation of each algorithm.   It also compares their performance and summarizes findings.  

# Exponential, Jump, and Hashing-based Search in C++

## **Overview**  
This project implements **three searching algorithms**:  
1. **Exponential Search** 🔍  
2. **Jump Search** 🚀  
3. **Hashing-based Search** 🔑  

These algorithms offer alternative ways to efficiently search for elements in an array or dataset.

---

## **How to Run the Code**  

### **1. Compile the Code**  
Use a C++ compiler like **g++**:  
```sh
g++ search_algorithms.cpp -o search_algorithms
2. Run the Program

./search_algorithms
3. Expected Output
The program will prompt for an array and a target value.

It will search using Exponential Search, Jump Search, and Hashing-based Search.

It will print whether the value is found and its index.
